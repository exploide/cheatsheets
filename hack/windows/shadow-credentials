# Shadow Credentials

Take over an AD account when being able to write the `msDS-KeyCredentialLink` attribute (e.g. GenericWrite).

This needs PKINIT support (introduced in Windows Server 2016) and a DC with a certificate.
The error `KDC_ERR_PADATA_TYPE_NOSUPP` shows up when this is not the case.

## Certipy (https://github.com/ly4k/Certipy)

- automatically add a new key credential, retrieve the TGT and NT hash of the victim and restore the original attribute value
    certipy shadow auto -u ATTACKER@FQDN -p ATTACKERPW -account VICTIM
